# DispNote

Sometimes you want to tell someone a private message but can't meet them in person or use an encrypted messenger app.

Sites like privnote.com allow you to send disposable and encrypted messages via a simple link your friend can open.

However, privnote is bloated and proprietary, this is a more bare bones version using crypto-js and Vue to drive the UI, with a small Go backend.
